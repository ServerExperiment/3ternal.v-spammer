This is made for just messing around with your friends, not for using it on servers to troll and be toxic on.


Its also another reason for discord to improve their anti-spam, such as cool down for typing the same word more than 5 times.
Discord really needs to work on their anti-spam, so look at this as almost a tool for Discord to improve with.

If i find out its being using for toxic reasons I'll remove it or if discord asks me too.
